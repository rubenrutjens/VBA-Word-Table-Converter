<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.
T

Here's some key features of this program:
* Able to upload multiple word documents and convert these to .csv documents.
* The program is made with user friendliness in mind. 
* The fastest way to convert .docx files to .csv files

This is a project which will be worked on for the upcomming 6 weeks. After this I want to fully finish this project and have it fully operating and working.  You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to setting up this program and making it functional!
